# Quizaire - A quiz web application
An amazing quiz web application made from HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, and Python web framework, FLASK.
Used a Parallax effect to make it look more mesmerizing and magical. 
Right now, only 3 categories are added i.e. Sports, Geography, and General Knowledge.
A login page is also added for user authentication. 
Future add-ons that can be done:
  1. Database can be added to store user credentials.
  2. An API can be used to generate random questions.
  3. A congrats page can also be added to make it more user-friendly.
  4. Multiplayer mode can be added to challenge your friends in a particular quiz.
  5. More categories can be added (like technology, history, mathematics, etc.) to give users more options.
