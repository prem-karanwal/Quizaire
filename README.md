An amazing quiz web application made from HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT and python web framework, FLASK.
Used Parallax effect to make it look more mesmerizing and magical. 
Right now, only 3 categories are added i.e. Sports, Geography and General Knowledge.
Login page is also added for user authentication. 
Future add-ons that can be done:
  1. Database can be added to store user credentials.
  2. An api can be used to generate random questions.
  3. A congrats page can also be added to make it more user-friendly.
  4. Multiplayer-mode can be added to challenge your friends in a particular quiz.
  5. More categories can be added (like technology, history, mathematics etc.) to give user more options.
